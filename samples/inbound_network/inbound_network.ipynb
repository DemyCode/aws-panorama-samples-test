    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This inbound_network sample application walk you through how to enable inbound networking port on Panorama devices, and how to run a simple HTTP server within a Panorama application. In order to focus on the inbound networking topic, this sample application doesn't use any cameras and any models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How this application works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Configure inbound networking port information and port mapping between host and container in JSON files, before deployment.\n",
    "1. In the application, start a thread to serve HTTP requests, and react to HTTP GET requests to some predefined paths. ( \"/py_object_stat\", \"/py_threads\" ).\n",
    "1. Confirm you can see the expected contents by opening the URLs with your PC browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start processing this notebook, some prerequisites need to be completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set up your AWS Panorama Appliance - [middle click to open document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/panorama/latest/dev/gettingstarted-setup.html)\n",
    "* Install \"panorama-cli\" tool [middle click to open document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/panorama/latest/dev/gettingstarted-deploy.html#gettingstarted-deploy-prerequisites)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\"><b>Security Warning:</b> Turning on a device port may create a security vulnerability. This sample opens a port to run simple HTTP server just to explain the inbound networking feature. When you open a port in your own application, please be careful not to cause leaking sensitive information, or breaking your application's behavior.</div>\n"
