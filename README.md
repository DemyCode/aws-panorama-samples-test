# Introduction to AWS Panorama

AWS Panorama is a service that enables you to run computer vision applications at the edge. By using the AWS Panorama Appliance with your existing network cameras, you can run applications that use machine learning to collect data from video streams, output video with text and graphical overlays, and interact with other AWS services.

## AWS Panorama Computer Vision Examples

This repository provides some examples to get you kick-started on building applications for AWS Panorama.

### Resources

* [AWS Panorama Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/panorama/)

Please refer to README file in each folder for more specific instructions.

### How to Run a Sample
* We recommend using an AWS Sagemaker Jupyter Notebook Instance
  + Go to your [AWS Sagemaker console](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)
  + Click  `Notebook Instances -> Create`
  + Choose the instance type (These were built on P2 instances)
  + Choose the Volume size in GB (20 GB should be enough)
  + Create Notebook Instance 
* Once your notebook instance is created, click the name of your Notebook instance
  + Go to Permissions and encryption
  + Click on the IAM role arn
  + In permissions, attach the following policies
    + `AWSLambdaFullAccess`
    + `IAMFullAccess`
    + `AmazonS3FullAccess`
    + `AWSIoTFullAccess`
    + `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess`
* Restart your Notebook Instance and launch Jupyter Lab
* Launch a terminal session and do the following
    + `cd SageMaker`
* Clone the repository 
  `git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-panorama-samples.git --recursive`
* `cd aws-panorama-samples`
* `wget https://panorama-starter-kit.s3.amazonaws.com/public/v2/Models/Models.zip`
* `unzip -q Models.zip`
* `sudo rm Models.zip`
* `wget https://panorama-starter-kit.s3.amazonaws.com/public/v2/Models/panorama_sdk.zip`
* `unzip -q panorama_sdk.zip`
* `sudo rm panorama_sdk.zip`
* `cd ..`
* `sudo sh aws-panorama-samples/panorama_sdk/run_after_clone.sh`
* We suggest using `conda_mxnet_p36` kernel for all use cases (Except specified in the individual README)
* At this point, the set up is done. You can explore the different applications in each of the folders
* Follow the README in the individual examples for information about the use case
